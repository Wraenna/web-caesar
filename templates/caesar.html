    <h3>What is the Caesar cipher?</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher,
      the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest
      and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution
      cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some
      fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left
      shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on.
      The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private
      correspondence.</p>
    <p>The encryption step performed by a Caesar cipher is often incorporated
      as part of more complex schemes, such as the Vigen√®re cipher, and still
      has modern application in the ROT13 system. As with all single-alphabet
      substitution ciphers, the Caesar cipher is easily broken and in modern
      practice offers essentially no communication security.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
